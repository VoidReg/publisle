# Publisle documentation

Start with **Core** to author, validate, prepare and publish semantic documents.
Core requires no citeproc, TeX, xmllint, Docker or Research template packages.
The optional **Research profile** adds scholarly preparation, citations, journal
sources and PDF/JATS export.

## Verification and project status

[Required CI](../.github/workflows/check.yml) runs `pnpm check`,
`pnpm test:conformance:renderer` and `pnpm test:conformance:p0`. The
[renderer gate](../tools/renderer-gate.ts) compares independent static, MathML,
migration, fallback/refusal and bounded citation outcomes. The
[P0 gate](../tools/p0-gate.ts) requires fresh passing evidence for TEST-01–13,
including actual Chromium runs. Missing or skipped evidence fails these gates.

The [Research workflow](../.github/workflows/research.yml) separately exercises
compiler/export fixtures and the PDF/UA validation gate. The
[Research evidence record](standards/conformance.md#research-artifact-evidence)
records locally verified English/Arabic UA-2 and English UA-1 fixtures and
their limits. A configured job or
requested PDF standard is not a passing artifact report. The
[conformance matrix](standards/conformance.md#claim-and-evidence-matrix) records
which scope each result can support. Local
[performance measurements](standards/performance.md) and
[budget snapshots](standards/performance-budgets.md) are observations rather than
required CI timing budgets.

`pnpm test:distribution` builds and packs the 23-package publish set, checks
packed entry points/types and proves the Core-only dependency/CLI boundary in a
clean consumer. This is package readiness evidence, not registry publication.
See the [release guide](guides/releases.md).

The [release guide](guides/releases.md) tracks remaining release,
registry and outside-consumer work. Documentation describes implemented contracts
without asserting that package publication, multi-architecture image validation
or public adoption has already happened.
